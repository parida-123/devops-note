				It is always recommended to check the billing dashboard regularly and monitor the usage.
			
			Pay as you use Model 
			
			
			Server :
			
				CPU 
				RAM 
				Storage 
		
			1 EC2 Instance -- AWS provides 30GB of Storage per month 
			
				1 VM   ==> 750 Hrs per month
				
				10 VMs ==> 75 Hrs / month  --> 10 Hrs (actual usage)

				Storage 
				
				OS
				
				Run a Application - Java/.Net/Python 
				
				
			EC2 Instances
				1 CPU & 1GB of RAM  	--> Instance Type
				
				Operating System		--> AMI (Amazon Machine Image - Server template uset create VMs)
				
				
				network
				storage
				
				
					Linux OS 
						ubuntu 
					Windows 
					Mac 
				
				
			Why we need VM (or) Why to Create VM ???
			
			
				
		To 	Create EC2 Instances ::::		
				
			1. Login to AWS Console 
			2. Goto EC2 Dashboard by Choosing EC2 Service 
			3. Click on Launch Instance
